##Project

Plant diseases are a significant threat to global food security and cause substantial economic losses for farmers. The increase in plant diseases due to a wide range of plant species and climate change, combined with their rapid spread to new areas, can make accurate identification challenging for experienced plant pathologists. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases are essential for effective management and control of these diseases. Keeping this goal in mind, we have chosen the PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle which covers 61K healthy and unhealthy leaf images divided into 39 categories. The dataset for this project includes various versions of plant images, including the original RGB colored images, grayscale versions, and segmented images with color correction focusing on the leaf. By using Data Science techniques, such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Deep Learning algorithms, we can effectively address the challenge of plant disease detection. Finally, pathologists can use our techniques through a real-time web application which will detect diseases in plants and provide relevant remedies. From our research, several studies have been conducted on plant disease detection using machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of accuracy and robustness of the models. We may seek guidance from open-source resources, but our work will be original.
